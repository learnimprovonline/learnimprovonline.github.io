{{Form Two Lines}}
Left side initiates a two person scene of four or lines total with an object as the suggestion.
Players try to establish the "who", "what", "where", and "why" of the scene.
Discuss what is happening in the scene with the watching players and identify what pieces are missing.
Players have another chance to include the missing "w"'s of the scene.
