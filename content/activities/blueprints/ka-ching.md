{{ Circle Up }}

The first two players in the circle begin a scripted dialogue.

P1: Hey, would you like to buy a [dysfunctional item?]
P2: A What?
P1: [repeat dysfunctional item]
P2: Can I [something that would make it functional]?
P1: Sure!
P2: I'll take it!
P1: Ka-Ching!

The dialogue then shifts to the player next to player two.

P2 to P3: Hey, would you like to buy a...?
P3: A what?
P2: A what?
P1: A [their dysfunctional item]
P2: A [their dysfunctional item]

Every response kicks back all the way to P1, including the "I'll take it" where P1 always does "Ka-Ching."

Continue until everyone has said "I'll take it." For an additional challenge, go around the circle more than once!
