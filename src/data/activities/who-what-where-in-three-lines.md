Players form two lines of equal length. Mix it up so players are not across from someone they've done scenes with already.

1. The person from the right line will initiate each scene with a single line.
2. The left person will respond with a single line.
3. The right person responds with a single line.

Goal is to answer the questions "Who?" "What?" "Where?" in only three lines.
Doing this will establish the scene for the players and the audience up top so the rest of the scene is less work.
Players switch lines when he/she has completed a scene. Continue until every player has completed a scene from both lines.
