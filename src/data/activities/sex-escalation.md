Players form two lines of equal length. Mix it up so players are not across from someone they've done scenes with already.
Two person scenes that start with a suggestion for a location.
Each person in the scene plays a character who is intensely sexually attracted to the other.
There is no backing down, only escalation.
Find your limits and break through them.
Players switch lines when he/she has completed a scene. Continue until every player has completed a scene from both lines.
