Three person scene with two players on stage and one player off stage.
The two players on stage are secretly given a specific "piece" of the scene to leave out (location, relationship, what is happening in the scene, and why the scene is happening).
They will perform a short 30-60 second scene intentionally leaving out information.

The third player off stage tries to find the most efficient way to fill in the missing piece.
When the third player knows how to "fix" the scene they will enter as a support character to fill in the missing information.
Use what has happened in the scene to create the support character.
