Players form two lines of equal length. Mix it up so players are not across from someone they've done scenes with already.
The right side comes out acting like a crazy old prospector and says the worst possible thing they can imagine.
The left side comes out acting like a crazy old prospector and agrees with the statement, supporting with escalation.
Players switch lines when he/she has completed a scene. Continue until every player has completed a scene from both lines.
