Players to stand in a circle with the order randomized using whatever method you prefer.
Players turns around so no one is facing each other.
Leader counts to three and everyone quickly turns around at the same time in one of the following poses:

- Strong Guy: Arms down in the classic Crab bodybuilding pose. Mimics the vintage Strong Man at a carnival.
- Cactus: Right arm up and bent ninety degrees at the elbow. Left arm down and ben ninety degrees at the elbow. Mimics a saguaro cactus.
- I Surrender!: Both arms straight up in the air. Mimics someone in a hold-up.

Loudly say the same of the pose you chose when you turn around.
The goal is for the entire group to be doing the same pose.
Repeat until everyone is doing the same pose.
You are not allowed to do the same pose two times in a row (a different pose each time).

Hint: Encourage players to look at the room and think about which pose to do next.
