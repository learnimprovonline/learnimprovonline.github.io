Players to stand in a circle with the order randomized using whatever method you prefer.
Everyone counts down from eight and shakes their right hand at each number. Repeat with left hand, then right leg, and finally the left leg. Say the numbers loudly and quickly. Make eye contact with the other players.

### Extend

Add silly attributes to some of the numbers. For example, if you say "be sad for number four" when you start counting down from four (only once) you would be act sad for those numbers. Accents, animals, or any other type of characters work well here.
